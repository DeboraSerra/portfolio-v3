In this project I was supposed to develop a JavaScript-based system to track, sort, and filter packages while discarding invalid data and deploy the solution on AWS to ensure scalability. The form to add new packages is meant to follow this rules: reject missing fields or empty entries, ensure numeric-only input for Package ID and Weight, display an error message for invalid input. After that I was supposed to use a sorting algorithm to sort packages based on their weight. Since the AWS EC2 instance was meant for academic purposes only and have a duration of 3 hours per session, the link below is for the GitHub codebase.",

The project was developed using Next.js, so we could safeguard the credentials of the project, and the database used was MongoDB.
